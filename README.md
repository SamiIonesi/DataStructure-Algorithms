# Data Structures & Algorithms
This repository describe the concepts of DSA.

## Story
I wanted to learn Data Structures & Algorithms, and I did, but I didn't want all the work I've done on this journey to stay hidden in the dark corners of my computer folders. So, for that reason, I decided to share all my hard work in this repository in a fancy way to help others to understand DSA.

### What is a program?
A program is a set of instructions that are performed by the CPU in a sequential way.

### What is Data Structures?
Every program that is run by the CPU has instructions, but these instructions are inefficient if the data aren't present in the computer. The instructions produce manipulations of the data.
Data structures are methods of organizing the data of a program in the main memory of the computer system at the time of execution or running of the program.

### What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step guide that leads you to solve a certain problem and that uses data and instructions for handling this data.


## Data Structures
To solve a certain problem, there are various types of data structures from which you can choose, but you need to know each of them, what are their benefits, how they work and so on, and in this way you can choose the data structure that fits best and is the most effective for solving your problem.

### Types of data structures

There are two different types of data structures:

#### **1. Physical data structures**

Def. : It refers to how data is actually stored in the computer's physical memory. This includes details about memory allocation, how data is organized in memory, the hardware architecture used, and specific performance optimizations.
  
  - [Arrays](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Arrays)
  - [Linked Lists](#linked_lists_id)
  
#### **2. Logical data structures**

Def. : It represents the abstract way in which data is organized and manipulated in programs, ignoring the details of physical storage. This includes the relationships and operations possible on data structures, such as accessing, inserting, deleting, and searching.

  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables

One of the important things is that logical data structures actually use the physical data structure to build them.

#### **Other data structures**

There are also various structures encountered in programming that are not typically categorized as data structures, yet they are still commonly used. These include:

  - [Strings](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Strings)
  - Matrices
  - Objects

> If you want to access the documentation for a specific data structure or algorithm, simply click on the blue links in the list above, which will direct you to a repository containing all the relevant details.

## Matrices

Special matrices are, in fact, square matrices (n Ã— n). 

Special matrices often contain a larger number of zero elements.

There are differite form of these matrices an they are:

1. **Diagonal** Matrix

    Definition: All elements except those on the diagonal are equal to 0.
    
    Matrix[i, j] = 0  if(i != j)

    Example of a diagonal matrix of dimension 5x5.

    *3* 0 0 0 0 <br>
    0 *7* 0 0 0 <br>
    0 0 *4* 0 0 <br>
    0 0 0 *9* 0 <br>
    0 0 0 0 *6*

    Because of this condition, the diagonal matrix can be represented in programming with the help of a 1D array.
    
    The following class will describe the diagonal matrix and necessary operations performed on it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

template <class T>
class Diagonal
{
private:
    T dimension;
    T* arr;

public:
    Diagonal(T dimension)
    {
        this->dimension = dimension;
        arr = new T[dimension]{0};
    }

    ~Diagonal()
    {
        delete []arr;
    }

    void set(int row, int column, T value)
    {
        if(row == column)
            arr[row - 1] = value;
    }

    T get(int row, int column)
    {
        if(row == column)
            return arr[row - 1];
        else
            return 0;
    }

    void display()
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < dimension; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < dimension; j++)
            {
                if(i == j)
                    cout << arr[i] << " ";
                else
                    cout << "0 ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }

};

int main()
{

    Diagonal myDiagonal(5);

    myDiagonal.display();

    myDiagonal.set(1, 1, 3);
    myDiagonal.set(2, 2, 7);
    myDiagonal.set(3, 3, 4);
    myDiagonal.set(4, 4, 9);
    myDiagonal.set(5, 5, 6);

    myDiagonal.display();

    return 0;
}
```

2. **Lower Triangular** Matrix

    Definition: A lower triangular matrix is a square matrix in which the lower triangular part of the matrix is filled with non-zero elements, and the upper triangular part of the matrix is filled with zero elements.
    
    Matrix[i, j] = 0  if(i <= j)

    Example of a lower triangular matrix of dimension 5x5.

    *3* 0 0 0 0 <br>
    *5* *7* 0 0 0 <br>
    *2* *3* *4* 0 0 <br>
    *8* *2* *6* *9* 0 <br>
    *5* *6* *1* *6* *4*
    
    The following class will describe the lower triangular matrix and necessary operations performed on it:

```cpp

    T dimension;
    T* arr;

public:
    LowerTriangular(T dimension)
    {
        this->dimension = dimension;
        arr = new T[dimension*(dimension + 1) / 2]{0};
    }

    ~LowerTriangular()
    {
        delete []arr;
    }

    void set(int row, int column, T value)
    {
        if(row >= column)
        {
            int index = (row * (row - 1) / 2) + (column - 1);
            arr[index] = value;
        }
    }

    T get(int row, int column)
    {
        if(row >= column)
        {
            int index = (row * (row - 1) / 2) + (column - 1);
            return arr[index];
        }
        else
            return 0;
    }

    void display()
    {
        for(int i = 1; i <= dimension; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 1; j <= dimension; j++)
            {
                if(i >= j)
                    cout << arr[i*(i - 1) / 2 + j - 1] << " ";
                else
                    cout << "0 ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};
```

3. **Upper Triangular** Matrix

    Definition: A upper triangular matrix is a square matrix in which the upper triangular part of the matrix is filled with non-zero elements, and the lower triangular part of the matrix is filled with zero elements.
    
    Matrix[i, j] = 0  if(i >= j)

    Example of a upper triangular matrix of dimension 5x5.

    *5* *6* *1* *6* *4* <br>
    0 *8* *2* *6* *9* <br>
    0 0 *4* *5* *7* <br> 
    0 0 0 *2* *3* <br>
    0 0 0 0 *3*
    
    The following class will describe the upper triangular matrix and necessary operations performed on it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

template <class T>
class UpperTriangular
{
private:
    T dimension;
    T* arr;

public:
    UpperTriangular(T dimension)
    {
        this->dimension = dimension;
        arr = new T[dimension*(dimension + 1) / 2]{0};
    }

    ~UpperTriangular()
    {
        delete []arr;
    }

    void set(int row, int column, T value)
    {
        if(row <= column)
        {
            int index = (column * (column - 1) / 2) + (row - 1);
            arr[index] = value;
        }
    }

    T get(int row, int column)
    {
        if(row <= column)
        {
            int index = (column * (column - 1) / 2) + (row - 1);
            return arr[index];
        }
        else
            return 0;
    }

    void display()
    {
        for(int i = 1; i <= dimension; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 1; j <= dimension; j++)
            {
                if(i <= j)
                    cout << arr[j*(j - 1) / 2 + i - 1] << " ";
                else
                    cout << "0 ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};
```

4. **Symmetric** Matrix

    Definition: A symmetric matrix is a sqaure matrix in witch the elements of Matrix[i, j] = elements of Matrix[j, i].
    
    if(Matrix[i, j] = Matrix[j, i])  then is a symmetric matrix

    Example of a symmetric matrix of dimension 5x5.

    *2* *2* *2* *2* *2* <br>
    *2* *3* *3* *3* *3* <br>
    *2* *3* *4* *4* *4* <br>
    *2* *3* *4* *5* *5* <br>
    *2* *3* *4* *5* *6*
    
    The symmetric matrix class is similar to the upper triangular matrix class; the difference lies in the display function:

```cpp
void display()
{
    for(int i = 1; i <= dimension; i++)
    {
        for(int j = 1; j <= dimension; j++)
        {
            if(i <= j)
                cout << arr[j*(j - 1) / 2 + i - 1] << " ";
            else
                cout << arr[i*(i - 1) / 2 + j - 1] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

5. **Tridiagonal** Matrix

    Definition: The tridiagonal matrix must follow next conditions:
    
    - i - j = 0 
    - i - j = 1
    - i - j = -1
    
    Matrix[i, j] != 0  if( |i - j| <= 1)  
    Matrix[i, j] = 0  if( |i - j| > 1)

    Example of a diagonal matrix of dimension 5x5.

    *3* *4* 0 0 0 <br>
    *2* *7* *3* 0 0 <br>
    0 *6* *4* *6* 0 <br>
    0 0 *8* *9* *1* <br>
    0 0 0 *7* *6* <br>
    
    The following class will describe the tridiagonal matrix and necessary operations performed on it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

template <class T>
class TriDiagonalMatrix
{
private:
    T dimension;
    T* arr;

public:
    TriDiagonalMatrix(T dimension)
    {
        this->dimension = dimension;
        arr = new T[3 * dimension - 2]{0};
    }

    ~TriDiagonalMatrix()
    {
        delete []arr;
    }

    void set(int row, int column, T value)
    {
        if((row - column) == 0)
        {
            int index = row - 1;
            arr[index] = value;
        }
        else if((row - column) == 1)
        {
            int index = dimension + row - 2;
            arr[index] = value;
        }
        else if((row - column) == -1)
        {
            int index = 2 * dimension + row - 2;
            arr[index] = value;
        }
    }

    T get(int row, int column)
    {
        if((row - column) == 0)
        {
            int index = row - 1;
            return arr[index];
        }
        else if((row - column) == 1)
        {
            int index = dimension + row - 2;
            return arr[index];
        }
        else if((row - column) == -1)
        {
            int index = 2 * dimension + row - 2;
            return arr[index];
        }
        else
            return 0;
    }

    void display()
    {
        for(int i = 1; i <= dimension; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 1; j <= dimension; j++)
            {
                if((i - j) == 0)
                {
                    cout << arr[i - 1] << " ";
                }
                else if((i - j) == 1)
                {
                    cout << arr[dimension + i - 2] << " ";
                }
                else if((i - j) == -1)
                {
                    cout << arr[2 * dimension + i - 2] << " ";
                }
                else
                    cout << "0 ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};
```

6. **Toeplitz** Matrix

    Definition: A toeplitz matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements along each diagonal are identical.
    
    Matrix[i, j] = Matrix[i - 1, j - 1]

    *5* *6* *7* *8* *9* <br>
    *4* *5* *6* *7* *8* <br>
    *3* *4* *5* *6* *7* <br>

public:
    TriDiagonalMatrix(T dimension)
    {
        this->dimension = dimension;
        arr = new T[2 * dimension - 1]{0};
    }

    ~TriDiagonalMatrix()
    {
        delete []arr;
    }

    void set(int row, int column, T value)
    {
        if(row <= column)
        {
            int index = column - row;
            arr[index] = value;
        }
        else

            {
                if(i <= j)
                    cout << arr[j - 1] << " ";
                else
                    cout << arr[dimension + i - j - 1] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};
```
