# Data Structures & Algorithms
This repository describe the concepts of DSA.

## Story
I wanted to learn Data Structures & Algorithms, and I did, but I didn't want all the work I've done on this journey to stay hidden in the dark corners of my computer folders. So, for that reason, I decided to share all my hard work in this repository in a fancy way to help others to understand DSA.

### What is a program?
A program is a set of instructions that are performed by the CPU in a sequential way.

### What is Data Structures?
Every program that is run by the CPU has instructions, but these instructions are inefficient if the data aren't present in the computer. The instructions produce manipulations of the data.
Data structures are methods of organizing the data of a program in the main memory of the computer system at the time of execution or running of the program.

### What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step guide that leads you to solve a certain problem and that uses data and instructions for handling this data.


## Data Structures
To solve a certain problem, there are various types of data structures from which you can choose, but you need to know each of them, what are their benefits, how they work and so on, and in this way you can choose the data structure that fits best and is the most effective for solving your problem.

### Types of data structures

> **Note**: If you want to access the documentation for a specific data structure or algorithm, simply click on the blue link in the next lists , which will direct you to a repository containing all the relevant details.

There are two different types of data structures:

#### **1. Physical data structures**

Def. : It refers to how data is actually stored in the computer's physical memory. This includes details about memory allocation, how data is organized in memory, the hardware architecture used, and specific performance optimizations.
  
  - [Arrays](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Arrays)
  - [Linked Lists](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Linked-Lists)
  
#### **2. Logical data structures**

Def. : It represents the abstract way in which data is organized and manipulated in programs, ignoring the details of physical storage. This includes the relationships and operations possible on data structures, such as accessing, inserting, deleting, and searching.

  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables

One of the important things is that logical data structures actually use the physical data structure to build them.

#### **Other data structures**

There are also various structures encountered in programming that are not typically categorized as data structures, yet they are still commonly used. These include:

  - [Strings](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Strings)
  - [Matrices](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Matrices)
  - Objects
