# DataStructure-Algorithms
This repository describe the concepts of DSA.

## Story
I wanted to learn Data Structures & Algorithms, and I did, but I didn't want all the work I've done on this journey to stay hidden in the dark corners of my computer folders. So, for that reason, I decided to share all my hard work in this repository in a fancy way to help others to understand DSA.

### What is a program?
A program is a set of instructions that are performed by the CPU in a sequential way.

### What is Data Structures?
Every program that is run by the CPU has instructions, but these instructions are inefficient if the data aren't present in the computer. The instructions produce manipulations of the data.
Data structures are methods of organizing the data of a program in the main memory of the computer system at the time of execution or running of the program.

### What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step guide that leads you to solve a certain problem and that uses data and instructions for handling this data.
